Han Ding is supervised by Prof. Abir Al-Tabbaa and sponsored by McAuliffe Civil Engineering Ltd. Hanâ€™s passion is about environmental impacts of current civil engineering industry. He is working on using cutting-edge machine learning approach to explore environmental impacts of sustainable binders in land remediation and regeneration.  

Before joining Cambridge Han completed his BEng degree in civil engineering at University of Sheffield in 2018 and MSc degree in Soil Mechanics and Environmental Geotechnics at Imperial College London in 2019. He has 3 years of working experience in civil engineering industry, on both client and designer sides. He has also conducted a diverse range of civil engineering research works as following:

1. Investigate potential correlations between city economic performance and infrastructure indicators, incl. roads, railways etc., of metropolitan city-regions within Northern Powerhouse; Research work was shortlisted to be the student research poster of 2016 in Sheffield and was invited to present at the house of parliament in 2017.

2. Predict the swelling behaviour of compacted bentonite using FE approach and comparing it with experimental data to evaluate the newly developed double-structure constitutive model for describing expansive clay.

3. Investigate current landscape of modelling flow resistance in vegetated open channel and use Matlab to form different analytical models for evaluating model appropriateness on simulating flow resistance in vegetated open channel.
