Natasha Balwit-Cheung is an MRes student in the FIBE2 CDT, supervised by Professor Abir Al-Tabbaa and Dr. Sripriya Rengaraju and sponsored by Arup. Her research focuses on planning for geothermal energy and the material and life cycle impacts of ground source heat pumps and thermo-active geostructures across multiple scales.

As a researcher at Architecture 2030, she worked with city planning and sustainability departments to analyze building sector energy use and suggest policy interventions to reduce them. At the Albuquerque-based planning and landscape architecture firm Sites Southwest, she worked on comprehensive plans and community planning for public clients. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Urban Studies and Planning from MIT, where she was also an Arts Scholar, admissions blogger and student researcher in the Urban Metabolism Group, and is a former fellow of The Atlantic.
