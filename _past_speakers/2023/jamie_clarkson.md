Jamie Clarkson is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT), within the Advanced Structures Group. His PhD, on the structural mechanics of novel tape spring geometries and their application to reconfigurable and pop-up structures, is supervised by Professor Keith Seffen and Geoff Morrow (of StructureMode).

Prior to joining FIBE2 Jamie graduated from the University of Cambridge with a first-class MEng in Civil, Structural and Environmental engineering, and was awarded the Archibald Denny Prize for greatest distinction in the Theory of Structures. His fourth-year project, titled “Solar Updraft towers for Greenhouse Gas removal”, looked at pre-stressed hyperboloid cable-net towers as a potential structural form for solar chimneys, and was supervised by Professor Chris Burgoyne.

His research interests lie in lightweight and tension structures, computational modelling, and sustainability. Outside of academia he has undertaken a summer placement at Smith and Wallwork and worked as a consultant for a private enterprise.

In his spare time Jamie enjoys hillwalking (or, in Cambridge, walking), birdwatching and photography, with his photographs of the Cambridge peregrines featuring on the BBC. He is a member of the Labour Party and has been involved in campaigns in his home constituency of Edinburgh South.
