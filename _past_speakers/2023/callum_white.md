Callum White is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT). His PhD is focussed on sustainable digital concrete and is funded by the EPSRC and Costain, he works within the Concrete Infrastructure Research Group (CIRG). His primary interests are improving the availability of data and information within the context of concrete design and practice, and the PhD will develop frameworks allowing for progress to be made towards improving the sustainability of the material.

Callum graduated from the University of Birmingham with an MEng in Civil Engineering with industrial experience. His final year research project was titled “Size effect in shear strengthened reinforced concrete beams” which included the testing of RC beams with fibre reinforced polymer bars installed using the deep embedment (DE) method.

Prior to his time at Cambridge, Callum worked as a structural engineer within an international consultancy practice where he was involved in the design of large-scale projects around the UK. Callum is a passionate supporter of social mobility and diversity within engineering, working to improve knowledge around climate change and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.
