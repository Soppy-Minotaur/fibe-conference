Douglas Morley is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT), within the Geotechnical and Environmental Research Group. His PhD is looking at the soil-structure interaction behaviour behind integral bridge abutment walls and aims to reduce bridge maintenance costs and embodied carbon. The project is supervised by Professor Gopal Madabhushi, Richard Shires (Highways England) and Dr Thushy Thusyanthan (Atkins).

Douglas graduated from Loughborough University with an MEng in Civil Engineering with four academic awards, also studying at Politecnico di Milano, ETH Zürich and UPC Barcelona as part of the UNITECH International programme. He spent an industrial placement year at Aecom working on high-rise tower structures and five summer internships at Geosynthetics Ltd. in geotechnical design.

Douglas’ research interests are in civil engineering dynamics and soil-structure-fluid interaction. His final year thesis explored the seismic performance of RC frames infilled with rubberised concrete masonry.

He is a graduate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and involved in outreach as a STEM ambassador.
