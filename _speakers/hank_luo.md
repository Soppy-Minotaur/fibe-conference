Peihang (Hank) Luo is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT), supervised by Dr Erika Parn and co-supervised by Gergely Raccuja from National Highways. Peihang’s research focuses on the visualisation and human-information interaction of the road metaverse (a system of road digital twins) and the digital road infrastructure system. Peihang is part of the Digital Roads of the Future Initiative and is sponsored by Bentley Systems, National Highways and Costain.

Peihang graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2022 with a BA & MEng degree in Engineering (specialising in Information and Computer Engineering, Electrical and Information Sciences, and Instrumentation and Control). Peihang’s final year project was about updating and storing road defect information in road digital twins using computer vision and deep learning algorithms with the aid of past road defect information. Peihang’s research interests lie in the human-computer interaction design of computer systems, especially with the application of Extended Reality technologies, distributed ledger concepts (to enable secure data exchanges), and machine learning / deep learning algorithms.
