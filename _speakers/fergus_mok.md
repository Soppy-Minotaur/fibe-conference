My Mres/PhD project is about digitising and integrating legacy National Highways data with the road digital twin, which is a digital copy of the UKâ€™s road network. My supervisors are Dr. Lavindra de Silva (academic) and Gergely Raccuja (National Highways).

I graduated from the University of Cambridge with an Meng specialising in Information and Computer Engineering. My final year project was about generating road defect information from images and point clouds using machine learning and integrating them with the road digital twin. My research interest is in how machine learning and data science can be applied to infrastructure.
