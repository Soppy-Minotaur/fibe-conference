Percy Lam is currently a PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment. His PhD research investigates on the construction and maintenance of a digital twin for highway networks. Supervised by Dr. Lavindra de Silva, Gergely Raccuja (National Highways), Graham Starkey (Costain) and Stuart Hudson (Trimble), he is working in the Construction Information Technology Laboratory of the Laing O'Rourke Centre for Construction Engineering and Technology.

Percy graduated from the University of Cambridge with MEng and MA (Cantab.) in Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering in 2016. He embarked on his professional career in geotechnical and construction engineering in a major infrastructure project on the expansion of the Hong Kong International Airport. He was admitted as a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a Chartered Civil Engineer. With an exposure to the intricacy in implementing solutions through his past roles in site supervision, design liaison and quality control, he is driven to carry out research to facilitate the digitisation of infrastructure assets. He is currently researching on relationships of defects on road assets, automatic image annotations and defect detection.
