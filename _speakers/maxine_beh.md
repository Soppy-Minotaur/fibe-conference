Maxine Beh is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT), within the Geotechnical and Environmental Research Group. Her research interests include innovation within geotechnical engineering practices and harnessing the thermal power of the ground to work towards Net-Zero. Her PhD will focus on ground improvement methods to enhance the thermal and mechanical efficiency of thermo-active geostructures. The project is supervised by Professor Abir Al-Tabbaa and co-supervised by industry partners Anton Pillai (ARUP) and Sandro Brasile (Bentley Systems).

Maxine graduated from The University of Newcastle, Australia in 2020 with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering (Honours I), as well as a place on the faculty commendation list and a university medal for outstanding achievement. She also completed a semester of her studies with the Department of Engineering at Clemson University, South Carolina in 2018.

During her studies, Maxine completed her industrial experience with Douglas Partners, and after her graduation, joined the team as a graduate geotechnical engineer. During her time with Douglas Partners, Maxine worked on a variety of projects focusing on mine subsidence, land remediation, geotechnical site investigation and most notably, the Transport for NSW M1 highway extension. In 2021, Maxine relocated to the UK and joined Hydrock as a geotechnical design engineer, designing shallow and deep foundation systems, retaining walls, and earthworks, as well as coordinating geotechnical site investigations in the heart of London.
