Shagun Garg is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT). He would be looking at Remote sensing applications for the monitoring of dynamic behaviours impacting sustainable development. The project is jointly funded by EPSRC and BP.  

Before joining FIBE2 at University of Cambridge, He worked at GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany on the Joint DLR-GFZ Project AI4Flood funded by Helmholtz AI.  

Shagun graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, with a master's in technology (MTech) in Civil Engineering with a specialization in Remote Sensing. He was awarded DAAD- KOSPIE scholarship to continue his masterâ€™s thesis work at Institute of Photogrammetry and Geoinformation (IPI), Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.  

His research interests include Land Subsidence estimation using satellite Interferometry, Landslide and Flood monitoring, and Deep learning for Remote Sensing applications.
