India Harding is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT). Her PhD will investigate the feasibility of utilising excavation waste and mining waste within earthen construction materials, improving their durability and their range of applications. Her project is supervised by Prof. Abir Al-Tabbaa and Dr. Chris Evans (of McAuliffe).

In 2019, India graduated from Durham University with a MEng degree in Civil Engineering. Her final year project was titled 'Sustainable Consolidants and their effect on the durability of earthen construction materials'. She aims to deepen the understanding of waste reuse within earthen construction materials during her time at the University of Cambridge.

Prior to joining the FIBE2 CDT, India worked at AECOM as a Civil Engineer and then as a Sustainability Consultant. India's MRes and PhD projects are a result of the combination of her academic and industrial experiences and interests.
