Wuyi Zhuang (also known as Zoe) is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT). She is supervised by Dr. Dongfang Liang and sponsored by National Highways. Her research focuses on the modelling of Natural Flood Management (NFM).

Before joining Cambridge, Zoe completed her BSc degree in Environmental Science at the University of Liverpool in 2017 and MSc degree in Environmental Engineering at the Imperial College London in 2018. She has four years of work experience as a hydraulic modeller in the environmental and engineering consultancy sector, where she had the opportunity to be involved in several flood alleviation schemes and flood mapping frameworks across the UK. With NFM being promoted by policy and wider industry in recent years, Wuyi is driven to carry out research to understand the performance of NFM in flood risk mitigation.
