I'm undertaking an Mres+PhD looking at prioritising interventions in infrastructure design and operations for lower carbon energy assets. The work is fully funded by the EPSRC, BP and Aveva within the Future Infrastructure and the Built Environment: Resilience in a Changing World (FIBE2) CDT and will be supervised by Dr Andr√© Cabrera Serrenho.

Before joining the CDT I graduated from the University of Cambridge with an MEng specialising in Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering. My final year project focused on construction efficiency and using manufacturing techniques to identify areas for improvement.

I also completed a Year in Industry prior to starting university working in the Wastewater Modelling team at WSP, and then followed this up with three internships with Costain working on site and within the innovation team and one with BP working within their construction management team.
